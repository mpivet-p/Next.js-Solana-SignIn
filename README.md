This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Its goal is to demonstrate how you can use NextAuth.js with solana/web3.js to autenticate a user.

## Getting Started

To try it out: install the required packages and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Click the "Select Wallet" button at the top right corner, connect you wallet and accept the `Sign In` request. You can then go to [http://localhost:3000/api/test](http://localhost:3000/api/test) to check to content of the session.

## Contribute

As I am not the most experienced web; Next.js; TypeScript; Solana developer, it is most likely that some parts of the code could be written with improved code. Modifications, suggestions etc. are welcome!
